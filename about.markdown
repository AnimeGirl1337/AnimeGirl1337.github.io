I generated this artist study to document what artist styles were trained in SDXL and which ones were capable of being reproduced. The images were generated with the following parameters:

| Parameter             | Value                                         |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Positive Prompt       | 'art by {artist}'                             |
| Negative prompt       | 'ugly, poor quality'                          |
| Image size            | 1024x1024                                     |
| Steps (base model)    | 30                                            |
| Steps (refiner model) | 15                                            |
| Seed                  | 1                                             |
| Hardware              | RTX 3090                                      |
| Script                | Official Stable Diffusion dual model pipeline |

If you would like to contribute, that's awesome! I have set up a Google Sheet to add anything these studies are missing. Please use this link and I will be adding updates as soon as I'm able to.
